Demonstration of tools for android recommended by Google and Authors

This project shows the best practices, tools recommended by Google. 
I will be using this as a standard of architecture, clean code and design patterns as baseline for the future projects in android, iOS and in Flutter. (Mobile Apps)
Few highlights of this project is mentioned below.

* MVVM Repository
* Dependency Injections (HILT)
* Clean Architecture
* Flows
* Coroutines
* Livedata and Lifecycle
* Data binding
* (Reactive programming approach) made similar as in Flutter
* A very minimal example of automated test cases and instrumentation testing
* Generic Networking Calls
